1,Abrasive Ale,4.77,"

Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter. Canned 10/26/16.

A: Pours a hazy, golden, reddish-orange color with a one-inch, foamy, paper white head with short retention. Thin, white, bubbly lacing throughout.

S: Aromas of tropical fruits and citrus. Pineapple, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, guava, and melons. Sweet and caramel malt notes. Milder piney and earthy hop notes as well.

T: Strong notes of tangerine and grapefruit followed by tropical fruit notes of pineapple, mango, and melons. The oats bring about sweet, caramel, and cracker malt undertones. Ends with piney, earthy, and resinous hops accompanied by a lingering bitterness.

F: Medium bodied, smooth, and crisp with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a slight dryness.

O: Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA. One of my personal favorites for the category and definitely in my top rankings. The fruity/citrus notes of the Citra hops and sweetness from the oats are countered perfectly with the earthy bitterness that comes with the Warrior hops. Very drinkable. One of the few enjoyable parts of the cold MN winters. Definitely worth a try if you haven't had it or worth seeking out if you're not within distro.

A:
It pours dirty orange with a finger of juice froth head.  Ok retention; isolated lacing specks. (4)

S:
Juice cocktail. Orange, mango, carrots, guava, papaya, etc. (4.5)

T:
Tastes like the smell would if it were skins instead of the fruit. Sweet hints but mainly light pithy bitterness. (4.5)

M:
Fuffy, medium bodied, juicy, moderate carbonation, coating hoppy-fruity finish. (4.5)

O:

I think Alter Ego is still my favorite of their beers, but I didn't like Doppelganger as much. This, on the other hand, manages to magnify everything well, which results in an utterly delicious beer. (4.75)

7,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.4,"

12 oz, bottle purchased in OK. Poured into Kane chalice and allowed to warm.

L: Small light tan head. Leaves no lacing but does have a persistent cap and ring. Beer is dark black.

S: Apples, brandy barrel, roasted malts, chocolate, floral and citrus hoppiness

T: Well, this is something different. A big shot of apple brandy up front (as a NJeyan, I am very familiar with Laird's and this hits the mark) and that flavor persists throughout transitions to chocolate, roasted malts, and floral/citrus on the finish.

F: Not quite full-bodied, but in the neighborhood. Very lightly carbonated. Construction is so very well-done, as these are difficult flavors to merge. Balance is not quite there yet; it could use more aging to round things off.

O: Very high degree of difficulty and it pulls it off pretty nicely.

Cherry red with a touch of amber, lots of carbonation, a hint of haze, and a finger of Pepto Bismol pink head.

Smells acidic and fruity, of vinegar, cherries, spices . Notes of cloves and nutmeg, deep, cellar like funk, and dusty attic, just like the Cantillon Brewery where I purchased this masterpiece at the end of 2013.

Sour, dry and fruity. Very acidic but with a softness that makes it non abrasive. The essence of cherries and red fruits are in there, along with the breweries classic funk and cellar and dust. Cobwebs come to mind, and macaroni. Floral notes are also present.

Medium body, moderate, foamy carbonation, and a very dry but smooth finish.

The label says 2011, so when I purchased this in Brussels at the brewery in 2013, it was already 2 years old. Today its been in the bottle for 5 years. Amazing, legendary, classic brew I've been cellaring in China and now in Thailand for 3 and a half years. It was one of my favourite days in Belgium, the day I got this brew. May 7th, 2017.

Huge aroma of dried cherries & figs upon first pour. Has the requisite Belgian yeast foamy head with lots of carbonation in the form of microscopic bubbles. A bit too carbonated & foamy for me, but a few quick swirls of the glass fixes that. Definitely a big beer, it is amazing this beer is made with only 4 ingredients. Lots of dried fruits, molasses, a bit boozy. Great brew.

A yin and yang of huge barny funk complete with gloves, dirt, tack room, muddy, bruised medicinal herbs, etc. balanced with an equally assertive sour cherry, red-wine tanninic, oaky, funky medley with macerated berry bushes (dirt, roots, leaves and all). It is very drinkable for as tart as it is (for my tastes at least) and has the subtle, near-constant, tongue-corner-mouth-watering-tickle-thing going on that makes beers like this a non-stop experience when drinking them, as its residue lingers and evolves in your mouth between sips.

Appearance – 4.5.
First pour – Light yellow, clear.
Body – Yellow, hazy.
Head – Enormous (Maximum eleven cm, aggressive center pour), off-white, medium density, stabilizing at 6.5 cm, slooowly diminishing to a thick, cratered cap resembling a lunar landscape. Large, three-dimensional foam islands hang from the inside of the glass.
Lacing – Decent – mostly a continuation of the isolated foamy islands above.
Aroma – 3.75 – Herbs and resin, perhaps a weak grape or apricot.
Flavor – 4.25 – Begins moderately bitter and resiny with distinctly no melon, fruit, or pine. Ends markedly bitter with a long hang-time. No alcohol taste or aroma (8 % ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.
Palate – 3 – Medium, almost creamy, lively carbonation.
Impression and interpretation – 4.25 - (-0.25 points for undated individual serving container.) I must admit I was unimpressed. Perhaps I was expecting too much from the number one NEIPA. The appearance was excellent so no disappointment there. The aroma was OK but was markedly lacking in fruitiness. The flavor was also OK, but again fruitiness was lacking. The palate was just what is expected from a NEIPA. Overall, a decent NEIPA but I won’t be driving back to Stowe except to revisit von Trapp.

Pours a true hazy orange with two fingers of khaki foam after an eager pour. Head retention is good. Aroma is papaya, orange, mango, guava, pillowy yeast and clove. Tropical fruits are pronounced and sugary. Flavor profile carries more of the same qualities, with papaya, orange, mango, tangerine and guava sitting on the tongue for a long while after each sip. Light notes of yeast, and bready malts round out the flavor profile, but the balance is still very clearly tipped towards hops. Mouth feel is pillowy and creamy with a medium-thick consistency. Overall, sweet, but overly so. It clearly focuses on tropical fruits, but refrains from becoming cloyingly sweet - a refreshing NE IPA characteristic.

Pours black with an eggshell thin layer of khaki fizz. Aroma is strong vanilla, with bourbon, char, and roasted and toasted malts. It smells like a vanilla Coca-Cola. Flavor profile is vanilla bean, milk chocolate, bourbon, char, and roasted and toasted malts. Bourbon is certainly present, but is balanced well enough to keep from being boozy. Really, the bourbon just adds a little extra character and depth in an otherwise thin flavor profile. All total, it tastes like Vanilla Coca-Cola, with emphasis on the vanilla. Mouth feel is thin, fizzy and harsh - it drinks like a soda pop, albeit a little smoother. Fortunate note here is that it thickens up just a bit as the beer warms, but it is still barely scraping ""medium-thin"". Overall, it's thin and harsh, which isn't good for any beer especially a stout. Vanilla notes are strong and refrain from coming across as artificial, which is a plus, but beyond that isn't much.

Served in a 12oz snifter from a 22oz bottle.

2015: 4.9 Best stout I've ever had. Luscious, thick, crazy nose. Like smelling flavors of a good whisky....some heat, then fudge, then caramel, then vanilla. Amazing beer. Aftertaste is of honey and coats your tongue. Certainly sweet but great flavors where the barrel cuts the sweetness of the base stouts. Had side by side with Assassin 14 one time; Killed it. and way better then 2018 SR. I think this beer was a happy accident that they will never recreate.

Happy New Year! Aged for four years

Easily one of the best fruited sours I’ve had. The aromas explode with cherry, raspberry, and cranberry, with a nice musky earthiness rounding it out. There is a prevalent raspberry/cranberry tartness in the flavor, but it is not nearly as overwhelming as most American wilds. The four years of aging in the bottle have mellowed out the gently sweet malts and alcohol presence wonderfully, and the result is an immensely smooth, silky, bright palate. Complex, fruity, estery yeast character. A very special ale, as it should be at ~$25/bottle.

rich malt base, with some pale grains, caramel malt, and booze (hard to hide at 10+ABV)

As a New Englander who has been to Vermont several times...I can't help but make the comparison (which I feel is apt) to Hill Farmstead's lovely array of farmhouse ales.

Simultaneously simple yet complex - Bernice comes through across all four sensory components with high marks. She pours slightly cloudy, yellow liquid that sits beneath a cap of white foam. Light, but lively, effervescence brings the beer to life.

Aroma is citrus, hay and light funk. Balanced harmony with each playing to the others' strengths. Restrained but remarkable. Taste is citrus - apricot, lemon and grapes - followed by a tart and funky kiss. Fruity and earthy yeast-notes throughout.

Tart, refreshing, appropriately acidic and lightly funky. Delicious.

Appearance - The beer was a deep murky brown color.

Smell - The nose was light chocolate, but there was also a coffee presence.

Taste - This is a sweet one. At the front, I notice sweet coffee first. Then, sweet bourbon accompanies raisins, figs, and burnt malts. Surprisingly, the beer was not to warm. Not overly cloying, the sweetness continues in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel - The sweetness lends itself to a sticky sensation. It is not as thick as the other days.

Overall - This might be my favorite day, notwithstanding Chocolate Rain.

L: Hazy golden-orange. Nice 3F fluffy head upon pour, good retention, leaves soapy lacing and a cap and ring.

S: Lots of orange-related citrus - I'd like to go with tangelo, please - and some earthy dankness with a hint of ripe tropical fruit.

T: Nose more or less predicts the taste. Very orange-y with maybe some...melon? thrown in. Dank, earthy, very slightly bitter finish.

F: Medium bodied, quite so for an IPA, light carbonation, construction and balance are strong and drying is good.

Presentation: 375mL brown bottle with the bottling date printed on the label. Served in a goblet.

Appearance: The thick, rocky, three finger head goes down slowly and leaves behind a lot of patchy lacing. It's a hazy, bright, reddish copper color.

Smell: It's a beautiful fruity and funky smell with notes of cherries, grapes, plums, raisins and wood.

Taste: It's a mildly sour, acidic and dark flavor. At first there's cherries, dried plums, and grapes. That's followed up by an earthy, humid wood note and a distinct herbal aftertaste with a touch of wine-y alcohol.

Mouthfeel: It's soft and smooth but quite crisp with medium-high carbonation. It's not cloying despite the sweetness.

Overall: A rich, fruity and complex beer with a lot of layers that feels boozier than the 7.5% ABV would suggest.

Shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks a lot, Brad! Served alongside Stormaktsporter.

2009 vintage

The beer appears quite similar to the standard version. Dark brown, nearing black, with a dark beige head that leaves an oily film gently descending the snifter.

A distinctly European aroma. It seems to me that Närke, Nøgne Ø, Mikkeller, etc. possess distinctive characteristics not found in American stouts. Hooray for diversity and the unique aspects found in beers throughout the world. Anyhow...the beer smells terrific. Roast, chocolate, barrels, a touch of booze.

The flavor does not disappoint. Thick, chewy, viscous stout that coats the palate and melts in your mouth. The barrel character is outstanding. Present, but not overbearing. Beautifully balanced. Dark fruits, chocolate, roast, malt, barrels blending together in harmony.

Highly recommended, should you have the good fortune to sample this.

Pours orange that nears on opaque in terms of transparency. Head is just north of two fingers of foam in the color white. Head retention is good. Aroma is pineapple, mango and melon dew all right on the front end. As these heavy tropical fruits fade, mango, orange, and lemongrass come on with hints of bready, toasty malts behind it all. Pineapple is the big player here. Flavor profile is mango, tangerine, melon dew, orange, and herbal/sticky hops with pineapple coming on big at the end. Tropical fruits start and finish it, with the middle focusing more on orange juice and bready, earthy malts. It definitely has a fruit smoothie sort of taste. Mouth feel has a touch of grain at the onset and then fades away quickly to produce a semi-textured and chalky, soft feel. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, big pineapple, this NE IPA covers up its 8% ABV extremely well. That said, it's sweet enough that consumption is limited to sips, but not sweet enough that it becomes cloying or burdening.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can.

91,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),4.83,"

Enjoyed a 2013 last night with my old man.

Everything about this beer just defined the word smooth, from the pour itself through to the finish. Nothing jumped out about any particular flavors, just tremendous balance throughout. The 3+ years of age (plus 12 year-old Elijah) have done this brew wonders, as the barrel has been tamed down to a wonderful subtleness. It shows itself just enough so you know you're drinking something barrel-aged, but that's all - something not often said about a big stout, such as this. In fact, considering the rather muted barrel and lighter, smoother viscosity, I could have probably drunk the entire bottle, which I normally can never do with any bomber. Curious how this tastes ""fresh,"" but with the $30 price point, that's likely to only happen with trade.

Cheers!

A - Pours sludgy black and opaque. Small bubbles on a mocha head of one finger. Minimal head retention but good boozy, spotty lace.

S - Baileys, Kahlua, maple, chocolate, licorice, wood, sweet milky chocolate.

T - Sweet, less depth than aroma. More Baileys, chocolate bars, iced coffee, Starbucks cold drinks.

M - Gentle carbonation, thick and full bodied. A bit cloying to finish with tons of maple.

O/D - Pretty delicious but a bit too far on the sweet side to drink alot of. Barrel isn't obvious but does a good job to round out the flavours and integrate the sweetness and booziness that is surprisingly well hidden. Flavours come as advertised. Deep and decadent.

On-site pour decanted into their branded wine glass. Dregs into a taster glass on the side.

Golden straw color, fairly hazy, but not near opaque. Light flows through and brightens the brew. Barely off white head, foamy, settles to ring around the glass.

Honey, white wine grapes, floral, slight yeast and funk. Lots of layers in the aroma. Citrus zest in the background.

Delicious, the honey is subtle and floral, delicate funk, some earthy and grassy notes. Tartness is present but doesn't overpower or block anything else.

Soft carbonation, smooth, moderate mouth-feel.

All around excellent brew. What farmhouse/saison brewers should aspire to acheive.

From notes 12/29/11: Pours a dark, cloudy reddish brown. The pour produces a single finger of beige, dense, short-lived head which leaves minimal lacing as it recedes. Aroma is vinous with notes of red grape, dark fruits, bubblegum, brown sugar, alcohol and very mild floral hops. Taste is very complex: dark malt and sugar, clove, banana, figs raisins, dark cherries, honey, molasses and faint chocolate; pepper and alcohol in the finish; alcohol intensifies in the aftertaste.

Citrus - grapefruit, pine, weeds, and a little yeast barnyard on a couple of sniffs.
Zingy fruit, grapefruit, pine, berry, there's an earthy component that I can't find the words for that I tasted in Crusher as well...not sure if it's hops/malt/or yeast related, but it's unique. Mango flavor shines about half way through.
Medium body, medium carbonation...nice amount of bitterness - not aggressive/over the top but more than expected for a beer classified here as a NEIPA, this strikes a very nice balance between NE and WC.

Look: Black and Tan, like the british shock troops.

Smell: If a bourbon aged beer could be brandy-aged, this would be that beer.

Taste: Alcohol is not hidden. Whiskey, maple syrup, molasses, roasted meat, herbs, a rich fire, game of thrones.

Feel: maybe my favourite part. Peer is cloyingly heavy, yet the foam/head/bubbles rise above. Again, it's like a black and tan in one beer, but in terms of mouthfeel.

Overall: The Night's Watch would be proud.

See-through urine appearance.

A rough pour yielded a big off-white head; a curtain of lace.

Pine, mango & honey notes in the nose.

Medium thin mouthfeel.

Honey & sweet mango flavors up front; faint pine notes on the finish.

Sweet, almost to the point of being cloying; this is normally my profile but was even too much for me.

Enjoyed after a nice rest in the cellar. Complex melange of aromas and taste - sour mash, oak, vinous grapes, dark fruit, puckering green apple and candied fruit.

No heat or zap from the ABV. Easy to drink and enjoy; nowhere near enamel stripping or harsh. A true beauty.

Thanks to Pipeworks for sending not just their delicious regular beers (Ninja v. Unicorn!), but also plenty of great seasonals. Keep sending & I’ll keep buying. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife.

The pour is a yeasty-looking, slightly clouded orange. The nose is, as stereotypical as it is, juicy tropical fruits & sweetness, though both are subdued.

Emerald Grouper is better than the soggy catfish I had for dinner…leaving fried fish to marinate in the curry wasn’t the best of decisions. The honey is stronger than most honeyed IPAs, lovely & right up front. It mingles with strong florals, white pepper spiciness, citrus, pine, mango, with a long chord of bitterness running all the way through. Heavier & stickie than your run-o-the-mill IIPA, which limits how much I’d want to consume in one sitting.

So few IPAs with honey manage to hit the sweet spot, but this one is the bee’s knees, living up to its lofty reputation. Excellent beer.

My man-crush, fiver29, sent this to me for two cans of Furious or something. That guy. I love him. Or maybe it’s just the alcohol. Maybe both. 22 oz. parchment-wrapped, purple-waxed bottle.

I managed to get the rubbery wax off without impaling a finger, which is good. The beer is black. Beautiful, dark, scintillating black. It smells like the gates of heaven. Seriously; bathe me in this before I kick off for Valhalla. Blasphemous malts, sharp peppers, vanilla, sweet sweetness. Damn.

Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel Aged would bring tears of joy to the eyes of Baal. Huge sweet malts intermingle with the (assumed) maple syrup; I wouldn’t have been able to pick it out, but I’m sure that’s what it is. The peppers creep in with a low, sustained heat, rich vanilla, marshmallows out by the lake, mild spiciness that I’ll attribute to the cinnamon. Zero barrel presence, but who cares? Thick, pleasing, & I’d like to shower in this.

I am reacting right now in a very similar way to the first time I had Cigar City Huangpu’s - something akin to gagkhdjaol. Mmmm. My only complaint is the lack of advertised barrel, but that’s like complaining about being in Prague for only four nights. Amazing beer & my wife thanks our Ohio friend, too.

Appearance: initially very thin when poured, which, strangely, transforms into a thick, luxurious and silky 30-weight. No carbonation or head; nearly flat in appearance. However, for they style of this beer – or rather for what this beer is – I think the addition of a head would be detrimental to its appearance. The beer coats the glass when poured, and recedes slowly down the glass (legs).

Aroma: heavy oak in the nose, sweet smelling. Light bourbon, molasses and raisins.

Flavor: holy shit is this sweet! It’s almost on par with drinking natural maple syrup. This is so sweet, I can’t imagine serving it anytime other than desert. That said, the beer is very good – though no more than a snifter in volume. This beer is sweet and complex like certain types of custard or a sticky bun perhaps. This beer doesn’t yield any cinnamon flavors, but each sip conjures thoughts of cinnamon. Maybe that is where the custard and sticky bun come from. Brown sugar, light molasses, raisins and oak. Light alcohol in the flavor but no heat, although there is a light warmth in the finish. Despite the bourbon barrel aging, this beer more resembles a brandy.

Mouthfeel: nearly perfect. Medium-heavy. Dense enough only to sip. This beer would be a meal to finish.

Overall: this beer exceeded my expectations. It is every bit as sweet as its reviews say, but it works. I’d recommend splitting this beer several ways as it is so sweet, it would be difficult to finish individually. A 22oz bomber could easily be split 4-5 ways without you wanting more.

Thanks to eyebereej for sending this bottle!
2013 bottling. Consumed on Dec. 18, 2016; reviewed from notes. Poured from the 750 mL bottle into an El Catador Barrel Aged glass.

A: Pours a hazy, glowing gold. Forms a thin white head that fades quickly with a relatively low amount of visible carbonation. This isn't bad-looking by any stretch, but appears fairly still. I don't know if that's a consequence of aging or not.

S: Earthy and funky barnyard. Oaky dry tannins, and notes of stone fruits (especially apricot, though I don’t think this that's actually in there. Some lactic tartness, and light biscuit malts in the background. I'm getting more Lacto funk primarily, with lesser Brett notes. A really nice, complex aroma.

T: Lactic tartness and more sour, juicy stone fruits (like a dried apricot). Earthy funk again – Lacto again, and some Pedio I think. Dry citric acid and tannins. The light biscuit malts are still getting snowed under here - it was necessary to search for them. Some dry white wine character. It finishes with some stone fruity juiciness and a drying sourness, and the dry flavors ultimately win out.

M: Light body, very low alcohol presence. Carbonation sensation is just a bit on the low side.

O: Wow…after sitting for three years, this lives up to both the hype and my expectations. And both of those were quite high. Especially as a non-fruited, non-adjuncted sour, it succeeds with a complex and balanced funk and sourness. I guess you could argue provenance vis-a-vis the “authentic” gueuzes of the world, but this absolutely could stand on its own in the conversation.

12oz bottle, Vintage 2019. It has been 10 years since I've had this one - way too long. Deep mahogany body is capped with a thin tan head. Big, rich, boozy aroma with oaky bourbon, roasted barley, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. On the palate, bold roasted malts and dark chocolate sweetness that lingers with notes of coffee, anise, bourbon, vanilla, oak, char, toasty grain, and bitter earthy hops. Mouth-feel is thick, smooth, and creamy; ample carbonation, alcohol burns the throat; finish is bitter with roast, anise, white pepper, and bitter hops. Just as good as I remember it being! I hope it doesn't take another decade to drink this again!

Growler into pint glass. Pours a dark dark brown with a minimal darak tan head. Initial impression is expresso, chocolate, booze, vanilla, maybe a touch of molasses, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth; carbonation is minimal. Finish is oily-smooth and yet conveys a warning note of the substantial ABV.
Cigar City makes some good stuff. Their stouts have, in my experience, been consistently excellent. Here's another one.

Pours a ruby-burgundy with a light fog. Head formation is nearly non-existent. Aroma is grapes, currants and oak all layered over a lactic acid sourness. Very straight forward, and focused. Flavor profile is grapes, black currants, oak, toffee and toasted and nutted malts. While it starts with sweet fruit, it ends with a lactic sour twist that lingers on the tongue for a long while after each sip. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth, glossy texture.

2011 batch. 12 oz bottle poured into snifter

A: Deep mahogany in color, viscous, with virtually no head or lacing upon a moderate pour.

S: Tons of caramel and burnt sugar at the front of the bouquet. At the edges, booze, sweetened. Notes of pit fruit linger.

T: The pit fruit aspect is more forward on the palate, with notes of plums and dates joining the caramelly overtone. The tobacco notes so prevalent in Adam are a little subdued here, presumably from how barrel aging rounds and smooths the flavors. Raisiny, maybe some holiday spice mid-sip, before a long, sweet, boozy finish.

M: Chewy, viscous, but not as much as might be expected for a 12% ABV brew.

Definitely lives up to the hype. A delicious brew with a lot of similarities to the finest barrel-aged stouts.

(2019) No. 5. 13.55% ABV. Poured from a 500mL bottle into my Portsmouth tulip.

Clear umber body with an ecru/camel/tan head. Lasting surface slick and popped collar; fine sandy lacing; good retention (given the ABV).

Pungent aromatics with rich bourbon notes, cocoa, tobacco, coffee, vanilla, and Belgian waffles in the nose.

Intense palate entry mirrors the aroma closely. Quite sweet, but the alcohol (and bourbon) cuts through with touches of char, burnt sugar, and cherry. Medium finish, decent attenuation, but with hints of cake frosting thanks to the vanilla. Mild but lasting bitterness - fairly clean malt bill and yeast profile. Dark fruit comes out more as the beer warms, with hints of treacle (while avoiding licorice notes).

Creamy, not-quite oily mouth-feel. Warming, but not quite hot.

Superb in some ways, and would likely age well, but relies perhaps too much on adjuncts compared to the best examples of the style which wring the most character out of the malt, hops, and yeast. The base beer is almost an after-thought here.

My first review after using this site as a resource for many years.

This was my first TH stout after really enjoying their IPAs. A 16 ounce can dated April 24, 2019, and consumed on May 10, 2019. The beer pours jet black with an inch of tan colored head. It's a beautiful beer. On the nose, big coffee and maple notes. It looks and smalls fantastic.

The flavor of the beer, however, falls a bit short for me. It's complex and tasty, to be sure, but it is almost overwhelmingly sweet. Chocolate, maple, and coffee are present, but there's no evidence of roasted malt or any hops. It's a quality product, but it's not my style. I can see why others like it, but if this is the style of Tree House stouts, I will likely stick to their hoppy beers from now on.

The mouthfeel is nice: soft and easy to drink. But it's undermined a bit by the sweetness of the beer - I didn't want to hold it in my mouth for too long because the beer was so sweet.

Overall: if you like drinking something that tastes like liquefied candy, you will like this beer, but if you prefer a more classic, well balanced stout, it may not be your preferred choice. It's worth trying, but to me it falls well short of competitors like Expedition, Speedway, and Even More Jesus.

Brown color with a thick thin beige head with short retention.
Aroma with notes of prunes, caramel, mild fresh floral hops, a bit of pine, nuts, and some chocolate.
Flavor with notes of floral and medicinal hops, some cocoa, mild candied sugar, prunes, pine, nuts, spices, wood, orange peel, coriander, berries, figs, vanilla and green pineapple. Dry aftertaste with a decent bitterness.
Medium body with somewhat effervescent carbonation. Alcohol of 8% is completely absent.
Aroma was a bit disappointing, but the mouth was quite nice given the fresh hops and complexity making this Dubbel as attractive as it can be. Sure, it does not compare to its big brother the 12th (unfair, different styles), but I had to keep raising the grade once it warmed up.

Pours a bright, opaque orange with a finger and a half of white foam for head. Head retention is good, as is the lacing left behind. Aroma is orange, papaya, mango, melon, and pineapple layered over biting pale and wheat malt notes. Lovely citrusy aroma luring in the lips for a sip. Flavor profile is smooth and round notes of orange, pineapple, melon, and mango. Tropical fruits are suspended over a base of wheat, pale, and biscuity malt notes. Hops absolutely dominate the flavor profile ratio here. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy, velvety texture that drives this beers presence from modest to unabashed. Overall, it's pack-a-punch without remorse. It carries a heavy weight, and manages to deliver it unbroken. Big citrus notes, both domestic and tropical, layered over thin, but firm, malts.

Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.

T: Taste was great also. Lemon and stone fruits were the headliners here along with that uncommon and nice funkiness.
F: Mouthburst was subtle and not sharp at the end, so it was nice-drinking throughout.

Split two ways; enjoyed by all.

Pours a charcoal black with a cardboard-colored head that lingers. On par with the good looking crowd of the style. Neither outstanding nor detracting.

Adjunct-free aroma is just fucking amazing. French roast, toasted grains, char, chocolate. Unreal. Balanced: sweet, bitter and charred.

Taste is a malt-forward mix of fresh coffee grounds, toasted grains, dark chocolate and bitter hops.

So smooth. Extremely drinkable; not delicate in the least but still a complex drinking experience with its cascade of flavors that washes over the palate with each sip. Minimal ingredients, huge body.

Poured from a pint can into a tulip

The aroma is darker than apricot, lighter than copper or amber. A dark golden hazy masterpiece. A decent one-finger head gives way to a persistent skein of froth and faint lacing.

Aromas of mango, pineapple, peach/nectarine, apricot, white plum, white grape, berry, and lemon/lemongrass, with hints of white pepper and clear alcohol. Just a touch of pine/resin. The brew has a nice complex aroma, but it is somewhat subdued. In other words--good, but it would be nice to have more of it.

The aromas were skewed more ""sweet""; the flavors are decidedly more bitter, but not unpleasantly so. Very well balanced, actually. Plenty of malt backbone greets the tip of the tongue, with peach, mango, grapefruit, and pineapple all present. The mid-palate is greeted with more malty sweetness, balanced with grainy/biscuity goodness before transitioning to piney and dank hop notes. The finish features a return of white peppery goodness and a touch a booze. The ABV is very well hidden.

The brew is medium bodied, with excellent carbonation, and never gets sticky, as brews of this ABV can sometimes be. This one almost gets to ""crisp"" level in its finish.

This is an excellent American DIPA. Well-balanced in every way.

September 3rd, 2015 - When I leave San Diego, this will probably be the most memorable beer of the many, many beers I had. For one, I had it at one of my first visits to any brewery since moving to San Diego. But it is also an amazing brew. To the eye it looks like a somewhat intense stout, with a brown foam and a thick body, but not too oily. The aroma is big and bold, and cold and saturnine, like the smell of cold metal, but with some cacao nibs on the edge. The flavor is the real appeal here. Creamy, rich but not cloying, it is decadent, and deserving. Huge gushing chocolate notes combine with deluxe and top-shelf coffee notes, like Bird Rock coffee. Better yet, this beer gets spicier as it warms, like a Christmas ale, and reveals shades of nutmeg and cinnamon. Could this be a rare 10 for flavor?!

Aroma is tropical fruit and something kinda nutty. Guava, orange pith, orange juice. White bread.

Flavor is tropical fruits, and a bit piney. mangos, pineapple, and guava. Orange pith. It is a bit hot and astringent, but it plays with the flavors on offer. There is a sweet, almost nutty, flavor that carries throughout and is absolutely delicious. The retronasal olfaction is like a whiff of fresh hops. Finishes bitter and a touch sweet.

The mouthfeel is a bit more than medium-bodied, with fairly high carbonation. Alcohol heat is noticeable, but is acceptable for the ABV. My first time drinking this, a few days ago, I did not notice this as much.

Overall, I understand the appeal of this beer. It is delicious, and incredibly crush-able. I am jealous of folks in VT who can get enough of this to get sick of it. This is my last can in a four pack, and it saddens me that I am moving where it will be even harder for me to acquire.

A: Dark red - almost magenta – with a thin light pink head and lots of visible carbonation. Quite hazy.

S: Tart and sweet cherries, tart cranberries, dry oaky tannins. Somewhat vinous but the lactic character dominates. Nice but not outstanding on the nose.

T: Tart cherries, juicy raspberries, and dry oak tannins up front. Fruity lactic tartness, yet stays juicy. Cranberry bone dryness and more dry oak flavors hit just after the swallow, and it stays dry and lactic throughout the finish with just a bit of lingering sweet fruit juice on the top of the mouth.

M: Medium body, alcohol presence well-hidden, and adequate carbonation sensation.

O: Very tasty and quite enjoyable. This hits a nice balance between the natural fruit flavors and sweetness and the sour/dry/lactic flavors. My only complaint might be the price compared to New Glarus's fruit offerings, although the oak adds a nice depth to this beer that those lack for sure. As a personal preference note, I could do without the cranberries. But overall, still quite good.

188,Coffee Abraxas,4.34,"

Pours black and after a very moderate intensity pour, nets near zero head. What head is there comes via a ring of khaki foam that lingers a long while. Aroma is huge, hitting all the notes of the base beer - cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, chilies and other spices. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder add a little dry sweetness. Medium-bodied, dark coffee is interwoven throughout the structure of the nose, never taking the limelight, instead subtly reminding the palate it's there. Roasty, toasty malts add firm and dark support, but are an afterthought to the additive flavors. Flavor profile is deep notes of mingling cardamon, nutmeg, ancho (mild) chilies and cinnamon with medium-bodied, dark coffee, and roasty malts up front. Medium-bodied coffee hits center stage for a brief glimpse between spices and malts, and then returns to lingering and observing from aside the curtain. While spices eagerly welcome each sip like a used car salesman do for a visitor to the lot, they quickly fade to show the frame work of this beer - roasty, toasty, nutty malts - in other words, robust and dark. Between the dynamics of spices, coffee, and malts, there are flashes of chocolate, cocoa powder, and molasses. Very dynamic despite a slightly heavy hand on the spices. Perhaps more so than any other beer I've had, serving temperature is critical here. Too cold and the spices come off heavy, but as the beer warms a touch, the spices meld into the dark malt backdrop, forming a sublime experience. As this beer nears the 50F mark, it develops a sublime balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a smooth, creamy texture that develops a fairly still texture when served directly out of the fridge. As the beer warms, it develops a more grainy, velvety texture, enhancing the experience. Overall, the headline here is ""ABRAXAS"", with the subtitle being ""enters a non-mutually exclusive relationship with coffee"". Coffee is present, particularly as the beer warms, but never steps into the limelight for more than a brief second or two. Due to the namesake of this beer ""Coffee Abraxas"", this is a slight disappointment, although it is still a dynamic, complex stout worthy of cozying up to on the coldest of nights.

Appearance: the color is a hybrid of lupulin and pollen – yellow. The head forms a 1-finger of white. Fair retention that fades to a thin veil.

Aroma: juicy pineapple and light spruce. Inviting. The hops smell super fresh. The malt is light and sweet.

Flavor: pineapple, mango and sawdust. The hops have a sort of muddy aftertaste, though, but not oxidized. Enjoyable nonetheless.

Mouthfeel: medium-medium. Spot on. You could drink multiple.

Overall: very good, but I can’t say this lived up to the hype. I feel the hype from this beer is due to being one of the earlier NE IPA styles available. To repeat, very good, but I feel there are other fairly accessible styles that are equally good or better. It is certainly worth trying.

Pours a clear chestnut color, no carbonation. One of the most amazing aromas I have ever had the privledge of enjoying. Tons of burnt sugar, dark fruits, raisins, molasses, dark brown sugar, nutty. I found myself smelling the small snifter well after the liquid was drank. It didn’t taste nearly as good as it smelled, which was fine. A little goes a long way with this beverage. It is delicious, but I would never buy a bottle. But, if a bar is pouring it, I am all in.

12oz. can served in a tulip. Pours a bright, hazy orange with a loose, 1/8th inch, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a frothy slick. Nose suggests cannabis of the can pop.

Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (cloudier to light) with a carbonation shy of bright and a mild acidity.

Appearance: The thin, quarter finger head goes away very quickly. It's a thick, pure black and leaves a small amount of patchy lacing.

Smell: It's a sweet and dark scent. There's dried fruit, ripe plums, grapes, vanilla, oak, brown sugar and smokey, roasted malts.

Taste: It's extremely sweet but with a hint of bitterness. There's vanilla, cinnamon, roasted malt, dark chocolate and a slight alcohol bite on the back of the tongue.

Mouthfeel: It's thick, rich, oily and with a distinct silkiness from the sweetness. It's not cloying at all and the carbonation is low.

Overall: A strong and complex beer that needs time to be truly understood and appreciated. It's also very versatile and pairs well with a wide variety of food and desserts. It feels more like a spirit than a beer and it's better in smaller pours spread out over a longer drinking session.

Received in a trade with @gibgink – thanks Dennis!
Undated can, stored at 42 degrees and served at 57 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Appearance – 3.5.
Body – Dark brown/black, opaque.
Head – Tiny (Maximum eight mm, aggressive center pour), brown, dense, poor retention quickly diminishing to a two mm ring and a very thin partial head.
Lacing – None. Not surprising for a 10.2% ABV drink.
First pour – Dark brown, clear.
Aroma – 3.75 - Roasted malt, dark chocolate, slightly burned coffee
Flavor – 4 - Starts slightly bitter with roast malt, dark chocolate, and, surprisingly, some dark fruit. The bitterness drops around mid-swallow and is replaced by an ethereal whiff of burnt rubber across the olfactory sense. Oddly enough, the burnt rubber is not displeasing but seems the natural end. No hops, no alcohol, no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.
Palate – 4 - Full, almost creamy, lively carbonation.
Impression and summation – 4 - Overall, a decent impy stout. Next trip through Arkansas, I’ll watch for it.

Poured from a 16oz can with a canned on date of 9/18/19; into a pub glass.
Appearance- very cloudy straw yellow, but with so many bubbles, it pierces the haze; thick, soapy white head that leaves nice sudsy lacing!

222,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,4.39,"

2018 edition (blue wax)- adds 24-month aged (oatmeal) stout, and uses barrels that housed 7-12 year old bourbon; 13.6%ABV.

Poured from a bomber into my Bruery tulip.

Opaque bistre body, camel foam, resolving to a rouse-able surface slick and lasting collar. Fine sandy lacing, viscous but thin tears.

Brown sugar, dark roast coffee, chocolate ganache, vanilla, tobacco, and rich bourbon fill the nose.

Sweet, rich, roasty, malty, tannic palate entry. Moderate bitterness, with hints of rosemary, thyme, and forest floor as the hops hover around the edges of the abyssal depths of bourbon/coffee, the latter finally surrendering to the former in the finish. Low notes of caramel, loam, and blueberry emerge as the ale warms.

A touch hot, the alcohol while by no means overwhelming, is unapologetic.

Well balanced with impressive layering of ages and ingredients (particularly in the malt bill).

A: Pours a nearly-black brown color with basically no head. No retention. Some nice effervescence.

S: Dried black currants, rich sweet toffee, a backdrop of bourbon, and a bit of dark cocoa powder. Not the most aromatic, but the aromas work together.

T: Rich, dense caramel, plum and black currant, and light cocoa and bourbon, with moderate sweetness throughout each sip. Despite the richness and sweetness, the finish is relatively short, which I think helps the drinkability: you can go back for another drink without any lingering cloyness.

Pours a turbid, peach-flesh like color with two and half fingers of white foamy head. Head forms eagerly even out of an 8 day old crowler. Lovely lacing left behind as well. Splendid start to the drinking experience. Aroma is tropical fruits - specifically, papaya, mango, and pineapple with a sweet marmalade note in the back. On the hop spectrum of bitter to sugary sweet, this lands at about a 60% sweet. Not overly so, but just enough to welcome a sip. Flavor profile oozes papaya, mango, pineapple, sweet marmalade, and peaches. Yeast is present, but just barely so, with a dash of biscuit malts in the back. The soft, slightly grainy, calcium-like feeling keeps this beer drinking smooth delivering those wonderful hop notes. It has a medium thickness that fills out the palate well without drinking like a meal. Overall, a sublime NE IPA. Loads of hop notes that remain well balanced. It is a touch sweet, but isn't overly so.

Batch 12. Consumed 9/12/16.

A: Hazy, vibrant, glowing gold/orange in the glass. This is a beautiful looking beer that looks like pure sunlight. Little to no head (a few medium soapy bubbles) on the pour, but a thin ring of tiny bubbles sits on the edge of the glass. A few wisps of lacing with some alcohol legs for sure.

S: Big musky funk character accompanied by HUGE tart apricot notes. More prevalent oaky pinot noir aroma fades as it warms, succumbing to the tart, juicy fruitiness. Bits of lemon and citrus, but nothing overly acidic.

T: Tons of tart apricot up front. The apricot notes change tremendously as it warms, becoming sweeter and incredibly juicy. The final sips tasted like straight apricot juice--absolutely insane. Bits of musty, cheese-rindy funk, but mostly just zesty, tart, juicy fresh fruit. Apricot is, of course, dominant, but but supporting roles are also played by green apple, lemon, and peach.

M: Medium bodied feel with bright, effervescent carbonation that glides across the tongue. Not a particularly creamy beer, but the unfiltered nature of the beer adds a certain weight to it. It has medium plus sourness, but nothing overly acidic. It's quite dry from the start yet so clean, making for an extremely drinkable sour.

O: I feel slightly embarrassed to say it, but this is one of the first sours I've truly sat down to enjoy and review. But damn, am I lucky to have such a perfect introduction to the style. An incredible balance of tart, juicy fruit, oak barrel, and musty, rindy funk blends with an effervescent yet delicate feel to provide an incredible drinking experience. For such a sour beer, West Ashley is refreshing and clean enough to go down very easily. Looking forward to delving deeper into sours moving forward!

Got this one from Gary and Carrie this past summer. Thanks, guys!

From a 16oz can into a pint glass

APPEARANCE: A hazy pour yields a two finger, medium looking, frothy, slightly foamy white head with good retention. A cloudy, muddy amber orange with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a faint cap and leaves some foamy lacing on the glass. A decent wisp remains until the end leaving touches of lacing on the glass as it empties.

SMELL: Lots of passion fruit, pineapple, mango, tangerine and lemon on the nose. Really, really bold and fruit forward. Some melon as well. Super fruity and enticing. Smells great.

TASTE: Passion fruit, pineapple, mango, with lots of tropical flavors up front. Melon notes too. Big finish of tropical fruits, some melon and caramel sweetness, as well as some piney bitterness and a touch of alcohol linger on the palate.

PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine with a bit of a burn and finishes mostly dry. A touch of bitterness lingers.

OVERALL: Excellent stuff. The nose on this one is out of this world. It’s a bit harsh for the ABV perhaps, but other than that, there’s lots of juicy goodness here to enjoy. Thanks again for the can, guys! Appreciate you thinking of me.

O:
Damn! This is a very nice beer with a lot going on.
It pours a thick, impenetrable black with a nice creamy brown head that settles in pretty well. The aroma and flavor are on the same page, with lots of sweet, chocolatey, nutty, caramelized flavors and aromas expertly blended. They are also (along with the mouthfeel) on the same page as far as richness is concerned. That is, nothing seems ""hollow"" or out of place. Rich and vivid flavors that complement one another. Really an excellent beer. My only negative comment would be that it is pretty sweet, but that is splitting hairs at the atomic level. It tastes like it should and pairs nicely with the cold December weather. And a nice version of Terrapin Station from 1978 (as referenced on the date stamp). Excellent beer! Thanks, papillon sinus!

Appearance: pours a golden color with a white head that disappeared quickly. No sediment, fully translucent.

Smell: barnyard funk, tart apples, squeezed lemon, and white wine. A lot of depth with a subtle earthy spiciness.

Mouthfeel: light bodied, slight spritzy feel.

Overall: excellent saison where flavors grow as a warms. Very well balanced and not overly spicy.

Bottle Date: 2016
Palate Contaminants: none

Color is a completely opaque dark brown. Fine light brown head that goes away quickly, although there's a residual sheen of very fine carbonation on the surface.

Scent is cloves, molasses, and cinnamon. It's also notably sweet. Slight bourbon, and there's a little burnt sugar that stands apart from the molasses. Slightly mentholated.

Tons of different flavors, and it evolves interestingly from the front to the back. Cocoa powder, cola, and bitter prunes up front. It's deceptively sweet, as well. Cloves, raisins, cinnamon, and smoky oak in the middle. Coffee is in there, but it hits late, along with a little black licorice. It's like a Greatest Hits of dark brews. Really good intensity, but room for improvement in the balance between bitter and sweet, and coffee and licorice isn't the best way to wrap things up. Still, it's really good.

Good medium-heavy weight. Not much alcohol for the ABV. Very well integrated carbonation, and there's a reasonable amount of it, too. My only real complaint is that the aftertaste lines up with the late (lesser) flavors than what's earlier.

Received from @SomethingClever – Thanks Dave!
Undated bottle (Other than 2016) stored at 42 degrees. Served at 50 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Aroma – coffee – no bourbon, no barrel. It does fade as the brew warms in my glass.
Head small (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive pour), tan, medium density and average retention, diminishing to a four mm ring of tiny to small bubbles and a thin partial layer.
Lacing – none.
Body – dark brown/black, opaque.
Flavor – wow! Coffee with stout added. Initially a little bourbon comes through, but when it warms on my tongue, the barrel and the alcohol become very noticeable. There is also a little of the char from the barrel present which contributes heavily to the aftertaste. No hops, no diacetyl.
Palate – medium, creamy, lively carbonation.

Interesting beer – quite unlike any prior coffee BBA stout I’ve ever had. This has more depth of taste than most, once you get past that initial blast of coffee. This grows on me with each swallow.

Thanks to Jim S. for this 16 oz. can, a long-time want finally coming off the board.

The black pour looks sticky & swishing like a wine snob proves it to be true. The nose is spot on as advertised: coffee, roast, sweet syrup. Lovely.

Double Stack is more subtle than I expected (with no basis for my assumption). The maple syrup & roast blend seamlessly, neither more dominant than the other. Beyond the core there is a deep bitterness from the coffee, cocoa, touch of vanilla. No hint of booziness, but smooth, sticky, & very easy to drink. Not too sweet at all.

In hoping for a maple syrup bomb, what I received was more like a standard issue breakfast stout that’s finely balanced. Very good beer.

On-draught @ my favourite bar in NYC.

Currently, this has a 100 on Beeradvocate, and is #57 in the Top 250.

Notes are regrettably brief given a bar environment.

APPEARANCE: Hazy orange body. Soft creamy white head. Thick coating of lacing adheres to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.

AROMA: Very faint and muted, actually. Pale malts, citrus, a hint of yogurty tang.

Aromatic intensity is surprisingly low. Quite a reticent beer aromatically.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Coating, smooth, wet, refreshing, tangy. Perfect carbonation. Medium-bodied. Soft.

Taste is less well executed than the mouthfeel. Flavours of yogurty tang, faint citrus, and pale malts. None of the juiciness and orange flesh vividness I love about Citra hops is showcased here. Still, it's quite well balanced even if it lacks intricacy and adequate depth.

Hop-emphatic without being bitter.

OVERALL: Undeniably good, though I think counting it amongst the best imperial IPAs currently brewed is a bit optimistic. I'm glad I got to try it, and it's ludicrously drinkable, but it isn't mindblowing work and fails to showcase the more impressive characteristics of the Citra hop in my opinion. Hill Farmstead erases any bitterness from this Citra-hopped ale, but some concomitant bitterness is desirable in an (imperial) IPA in my opinion.

Absolutely worth trying, but far from incredible or world-class.

Pours black with a finger of caramel-colored foam. Head retention is poor. Aroma is maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, oak, and roasty and toasty malts. Very deep aroma with a springy sweetness. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty and caramely malts and medium-roast coffee, chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, toffee and caramel. A touch of bourbon and its heat and woody oak balances out the sweetness a little. It's sweet, but not overly sweet. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a very smooth and lightly creamy texture. It's thickness and consistency is medium-thick. Overall, maple syrup and coffee is huge and pairs well with bourbon. Heat is minimal, especially when considering the 11% ABV.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 22oz bottle.

The smell was the high point for me -- so much hops, I felt like I was standing in a brewery.

Initial taste entry was quite acidic and carbonated. Taste levels out to include citrus (grapefruit, pineapple) with a long, bitter -- but not unpleasant -- finish.

Brewed for 4th anniversary, reviewed 7/4/16.

A: Haze for days. Slightly darker orange color with an off-white head filled with tiny packed bubbles.

S: Explosive nose. It's an insanely intense tropical fruit smoothie. Oranges, mangoes, peaches, pineapples. A bit of an herbaceous note behind that. This may be the best nose on a beer I've ever smelled.

T: Taste follows the nose down the road to the tropics. Easy drinking 8.4%, no hints of booze or malts. It's almost not a beer except for a pleasant bitterness after the hit of flavor. It's a tropical fruit smoothie and it is fantastic.

F: Medium thickness, low carbonation. Not as thick as something like Green, but still a typical Tree House mouth feel.

O: Aboslutely amazing beer, nearly perfect. A little more mouth feel is the only improvement to be made. My favorite from Tree House to date. Probably my favorite hoppy beer to date.

2016 vintage at Himmeriget in Copenhagen.

Awesome looking beer, dark purple with lots of visible bubbles.

As soon as you open the bottle, the smell of blueberries smacks you in the face. Pouring it and sniffing into the glass shows what a great lambic is all about. The blueberries mingle with sour, funky notes, with hints of raspberries. I could smell this for hours...

Taste follows the nose, very pronounced blueberries with a bit of raspberry, and just the right acidity.

Mouthfeel is bubbly and lively, way too easy to drink!

This is one of the best sours I've had, perfect balance, gorgeous too look at and the nose is amazing. Manages to live up to the ridiculous hype surrounding it.

One of the rare reviews I'll do, NOT from stream-of-consciousness, but rather from notes I wrote down. I drank this can in the mountains a few hours ago, in silence, save for the rushing river next to me. An experience.

A world of thanks to Jon for this can.

Pint can dated 10/11/18 - poured into a tulip at about 45 degrees.

Pours an unbelievable glowing neon orange juice color. Completely opaque. Creamy, milky, turbid, murky, all of it. Haze for dayz. Almost literally glows in the dark.

Nose has an undeniable dankness to it, and some exotic floral notes I cannot place. Creamy and musty with round, yeasty notes. Very unique hopping. Overall, the nose is mellow, but what it has going on is unique. Truly smells like a hop galaxy, if that makes any sense. I know it doesn't.

Palate is earthy eucalyptus, lavendar, manuka honey notes, vanilla, and some exotic floral accents, that I have not experienced before. Moderate to decent sweetness in the middle, and finishes with ZERO bitterness. Some Douglas fir (piney lemon) dryness, but absolutely no bitterness. Finishes floral, pine, eucalyptus, and yeast notes. Vanilla lingers extremely long into the finish. Getting what I can only describe as a birthday cake note. Cake batter. Flavor profile is very round, full, floral, earthy, and impressions of sweet things without the sweetness.

Mouthfeel on this is truly divine, and even goes toe to toe with Julius. Luscious, pillowy, soft, round, full. The word in a nutshell is fluffy. This is a fluffy beer. Excellent carbonation gives it a touch of lift, but doesn't sharpen it. World class feel. Amazing.

Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. A truly delicious and pleasing beer. Satisfying. Exotic hops give unique floral impressions that I haven't experienced before. Must be unique to Galaxy. Restrained, balanced, and soft spoken. It doesn't come out and demand you acknowledge it's presence. It remains quiet, mysterious, and alluring, and waits for you to come to it, recognizing its greatness on your own. I enjoyed every last drop of this beer, and will seek it out again at all costs. You should too, because it is a fantastic beer, with a fantastic feel, and some very unique character and nuance. Special.

Taste: sweet and sweet, with bourbony alcohol bite at the finish. Lots more dried fruit, coffee, chocolate.

Golden honey color only slightly hazy. Pure white foam, cover recedes to a thin cover later. Lace for days.

Canned on: 12/18/18.
Opened on: 12/19/18.....FRESH.

Light and sweet , tropical red fruity aromatics kick it off. Green grassy fields of wet July summer, grains of barley, wheat and spelt come forth from the husky portion of hops and malt.

West coast style sweet fruity hops, higher alpha acids, green and dried earth combo. Sweet, boozy, malty effects become heady. Dense Amber, honey sweet malt gives it that signature west coast style approach.

A classic, Amber and Medium-bodied brew, ipa. A nice peppery, earthy pine sap finish rounds it all out.

Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam that retains really well. Aroma is heavy maple syrup and coffee with robust notes of roasty, toasty, bready malts and spry vanilla beans just beyond. It smells like a fresh slice of toast, dressed and drenched by maple syrup, while a roasty, steaming cup of coffee sits just aside. Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency. Overall, a thick and sugary beer, that while it lands more in the dessert beer category, does present itself exceptionally well as balanced and filling.

Pours orange with a clarity that is nearly translucent with the first 12oz of the beer poured into the glass. It turns to a starburst opaque translucence when the final ounces are poured into the glass. Head is a finger and a half of white foam. Aroma is orange, tangerine, papaya, and light guava. Tropical citrus notes are heavy and out front, with biscuity, earthy, nutty malts and herbal hops adding a big backdrop. Flavor profile is orange, tangerine, papaya, and guava with notable herbal, floral hops and biscuity, earthy, nutty malts. Despite the naming of 'Northeast IPA', the hops are much stickier and less sweet than others of the style. Malts still serve as a backdrop, but not an after thought. It carries a quality balance between hops and malts, while leaning lightly towards the sweet side. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a crisp texture that touches on effervescent.

298,Bourbon Paradise,4.81,"

The beer pours a Pitch Black with a medium sized khaki head. The beer has low carbonation. It smells of coconut, vanilla, whipped cream, marzipans, and a little bourbon. It tastes of toasted coconut, vanilla, egg whites, whipped cream, marzipans, and bourbon. The body is medium full. This is an amazing stout, there are so many coconut stouts these days but this one stood out in a big way.

299,Congress Street IPA,4.28,"

Canned on 2/6/18 . 16 oz. Can. That was popped on 2/14/18

A murky..lo.k hazy....white gold that has an orange tint. I swear, Trillium IPA's look the same. NEipa. A finer than usual, white foam keeps a solid ring and light cover. Minimal lacing, despite one big quarter moon shaped ring.

Super-robust hoppy aromatics. Freshly picked spruce tips and hand crushed hops give off some deep aroma's : sweet mandarin orange, peppery pineapple, cantalope, strawberry tarts and maybe a tropical fruut juice blend. Dense, Heady nose.

O.k...so, the malt usually hits me first, in this case it's, chunky, light bodied effect with wild honey pie, man....yeah, herbal and light wheat/grains are light but heady. Melons, starfruit, agave nectar and pineapple juice seem to make up most of the rest of the hoppy complexity. Maybe some stark, leafy, dry, earthy tones follow in a rather sticky way.

The feel is super crispy, heady, dry, earthy, semi-bitter, peppery with very little malty effects. Light to lush, smooth, maybe juicy? And d r y.

Overall, A typical Trillium effort, mildly different effects from each ""street"" version ipa.
